### Person

Aging scientist / software developer / hacker learning to use newer tools (`dask`, `numpy`, `openCL`, `CUDA` with a little HLS) - and now moving on to lower level matters like assembly programming, DMA, interrupt and real-time systems on microcontrollers, which is a lot of fun.

Pronouns: he / him / his

### Work

High performance data handling, experiment control systems, automation, automated data analysis, smart algorithms. Knowing stuff about synchrotron MX. Moving west to NE-CAT / Cornell university in the near future.

### Play

Programming µcontrollers at the moment (RP2040 / 2350 and SAMD51 right now) - starting with µpython but more `C`, assembly, CMSIS now (though really interested about using PIO blocks - they're cool).

Also dredging up some HPC stuff from "back in the day" to re-learn GPU programming etc. in hobby time. Hobby time is where the good stuff happens like [FPGA spot finder prototype](https://github.com/graeme-winter/fpga-spot-finder).
