### Person

Aging scientist / software developer / hacker learning to use newer
tools (hello `dask`, `numpy`, `openCL` & friends) - and now moving on
to lower level matters like assembly programming, DMA, interrupt and
real-time systems on microcontrollers, which is a lot of fun.

Pronouns: he / him

### Work

High performance data handling, experiment control systems,
automation, automated data analysis, smart algorithms. Knowing stuff
about synchrotron MX.

### Play

Programming Âµcontrollers at the moment (pi pico right now) - starting
with Âµpython but looking to maybe migrate over to `C` (though really
interested about using PIO blocks ðŸ¤” Still at the driving servo /
reading ADC phase though. And having to put together some basic tools for 
working with `picoscroll` top.

Trying to make these things "proper" e.g. with the 
[picoripheral](https://github.com/winter-special-projects/picoripheral)

Also dredging up some HPC stuff from "back in the day" to re-learn GPU
programming etc. in hobby time.
